## Notes

### The user should be able to add notes to the system via a modal.


### The system should display notes that have been entered.

### The system should be programmed in React.

### It should support two types of notes.
  1. A note which contains text
  2. A note which contains text and a due date.

### The system should also be programmed in a way that allows the system administrator the ability to add additional unforeseen types of notes.

### The system should read a configuration file. The configuration file should describe:
  1. What component to use to display each type of note
  2. What component to use in the modal for collecting information for each type of note

### The system does not need to be beautiful, but it should have some styling.

### Please use a state management system of your choosing

### Please write two unit tests
